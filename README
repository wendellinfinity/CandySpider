CandySpider game (whack-a-spider)

This is a project made for the trick or treat event in our office. This is a game based on the whack-a-something arcade stations at the mall. The entire solution is made in .Net and only involves simple electronics. Visit wendellinfinity.wordpress.com for the write-up.

The code is heavily commented

[CandySpider]
WPF program for the game interface. Counts the spiders hit by watching the serial port used by XBEE. It can also use any serial device as long as it sends "[hit]" string to signal the interface for a spider hit.

Highlights:
- simple animation using Image and png sprites
- Threading and DispatchTimers
- Serial port

[CandySpiderController]
Netduino program that sends serial output to the host. Simple circuitry but the code involves some nice techniques.

Highlights:
- Multithreading
- InterruptPort
- use of input and output port for boolean logic
- and more multithreading!

Hope you enjoy and create your own whack-a-something game!
